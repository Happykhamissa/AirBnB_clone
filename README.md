## AirBnB Clone :Console
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

## How to start it?
- Run the necessary script in the terminal

## How to use it?
- In **Interactive mode**, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command ./console.py

- In **Non-interactive mode**, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts echo "help" | ./console.py
